    Pseudo Class    -   A keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).
                        but if any element is set with help of id that can not be changed by the steps written below. 
        
        i   -   :hover  ->  hover means when we take cursor on any element that is known as hover.
                        button:hover{

                            color: white;

    CSS : Cascading StyleSheets ->  The CSS cascading algorithm's job is to select CSS declarations in order to determine the correct values for CSS properties.
                                    says that if two prperties are applied to a same tag than 2nd property will be the final one.
                                    Or if we create more than 1 css file for a single html file than the css file which is included at last in that html file will applied to that html.
                    h2{
                        background-color: yellow;
                    }

                    h2{
                        background-color: blue;     //Final color is blue. 
                    }

        Selector Specificity -> Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration.
                    id > class > element.

                    id  ->  is most important
                    class   ->  is secont most
                    element ->  is third most.

            Inline Specificity  ->  Incline specificity are more specific than id it is most prior to others.
                                    This way is not used in practice.
