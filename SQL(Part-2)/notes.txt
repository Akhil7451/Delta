Clause    -   To define some conditions

    *   WHERE   -   to find data according to specifc condition. 

            SELECT * FROM User
            WHERE Followers >= 200;   //give list of users whose foloowers >= 200

            SELECT Name, Followers FROM User    //to print Name anf followers only.
            WHERE Followers >= 200;

        ->  Operators   -   We can perform following task using these operators.

                *   Arithmetic Operators    -   (+), (-), (*), (/), (%)
                *   Comparison Operators    -   (=), (!=), (>), (>=), (<=)
                *   Logical Operators       -   
                    ->  AND     -   when we want to add two or more conditions where both conditions should be true
                    ->  OR      -   when we want if one condition is true.
                    ->  NOT     -   to negate the given condition.  (WHERE Age NOT IN(14, 16);)
                    ->  IN      -   matches any value in the list.  (WHERE Email IN ("adam@gmail.com", "bob123@gmail.com");, WHERE Age IN (14, 16);)
                    ->  BETWEEN -   selects for a given range.  (WHERE Age BETWEEN 15 AND 17)
                    ->  ALL     -   
                    ->  LIKE    -   
                    ->  ANY     -   
                *   Bitwise Operators       -   (&), (|)

    *   LIMIT   -   Sets a upper limit on number of(tuples) rows to be returned.
                    It will give the data in range if limit is 2 it will show data only 2 users.

            SELECT * FROM User
            WHERE Age > 14
            LIMIT 2;

    *   Oreder by-  To sort in ascending(ASC) or descending order(DESC)

            SELECT * FROM User
            ORDER BY Age ASC; 

    *   Aggregate Functions -   Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values, and return a single value.

        *   COUNT() -   Count of the given data.
        *   MAX()   -   Max from the given data.
        *   MIN()   -   Min from the given data.
        *   SUM()   -   Sum of given data.
        *   AVG()   -   Avg of given data.

            SELECT AVG(Age)
            FROM User;

    *   Group by    -   Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
                        It collects data from multiple records and groups tha result by one or more column.
                        Generallu we use group by eith some aggregate function.

                SELECT Age, COUNT(Id)
                FROM User
                GROUP BY Age;

    *   Having      -   Similar to WHERE i.e. applies some conditon on rows, but it is used when  we want to apply any condition after grouping.
                        WHERE is for table, HAVING is for group
                        Grouping is necessary for HAVING.

                SELECT age, MAX(Followers)
                FROM User
                GROUP BY Age
                HAVING max(Followers > 200);

General Order   -   When we want to add more than one clause than they should be in this order.

        SELECT column(s)
        FROM table_name
        WHERE condition
        GROUP BY column(s)
        HAVING condition
        ORDER BY column(s) ASC;

Table Queries   -   Some are in previous and rest are explained here

    *   Update  -   Update data inside table
                    When we are using UPDATE command in SQL first time it will give eroor so we have to write 
                    additional command

                    SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;       //this allow us to update out data in SQL

                    UPDATE User
                    SET Followers = 600
                    WHERE Age = 16;

    *   Delete  -   Delete the entire table

            DELETE FROM User
            WHERE Age = 14;     If we don't use WHERE with DELETE it will Delete our Table.

    *   Alter   -   To chaneg Schema(columns)

        ->  ADD Column  -   To add a new column in out data.

                ALTER TABLE table_name
                ADD COLUMN column_name datatype constraint;
        
        ->  DROP Column -   Delete column from table.

                ALTER TABLE table_name
                DROP COLUMN column_name;

        ->  RENAME Table    -   Change the name of emtire table

                ALTER TABLE table_name
                RENAME TO new_table_name;

        ->  CHANGE Column(rename)   -   rename the column name.

                ALTER TABLE table_name
                CHANGE COLUMN old_name new_name new_datatype new_constraint;

        ->  MODIFY Column -   modify datatype/constraint.

                ALTER TABLE table_name
                MODIFY col_name new_datatype new_constraint; 


    *   Truncate-   To delete entire data inside table
                    If we had links with any other table we can not TRUNCATE the Table so first we have to remove the link.
                    By (DROP linked_table_name) deleting the another table.

                TRUNCATE TABLE User;
