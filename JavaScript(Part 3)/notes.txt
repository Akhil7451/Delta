String Methods

    Method  -   actions that can be performed on objects.
                stringName.method();

        i   -   str.trim()
                Trims whitespaces from both ends of string & returns a new one.
                    stringName.trim();
        
        ii  -   str.toUpperCase()   //STRING
        iii -   str.toLowerCase()   //string

String Methods with Arguments   -   Arguments is some value that we pass to the method.
                stringName.method(arg)  // arg -> Arguments

        i   -   indexOf()   -   return first index of occurence of some value you passed as an argument, if not found will give -1.
                                stringName.indexOf("a");

        ii  -   slice()     -   returns a part of the original string as a new string.
                                stringName.slice(5);    // 

        iii -   replace()   -   searches a value in the string & returns a new string with the value replaced.
                                    stringName.replace("love", "do")    // "IloveCoding"   -   "IdoCoding"

        iv  -   repeat()    -   returns a string with the number of copies of a string.
                                stringName.repeat()     // "MangoMangoMango"

Array (Data Structure)  
        Linear collection of things. Arrays are object types.
        let student1 = ["akhil", "akshat", "amit", "hatya", "aditya"]

        Visualizing Array       -       we can also create mixed array this can be done onky with js
                                        let info = ["Akhil", 23, 89.9];

                                        info.length();  // to find the length of array.
                                        info[1];        // print the valye of index 1
                                        info[0][0];     // first [0] will gives the string of array and 2nd [0] print the 0th index value of that string which is at oth index.
        Arrays are Mutable      -       we can change array according to our requirement.
                        let fruits = ["mango", "apple", "litchi"];
                        fruits[0] = "banana";   // ["banana", ]

        Array Methods   -       
                i       -       .push();        ->      add an element to end of an array.
                ii      -       .unshift();     ->      adds elements at beginning of an array and
                iii     -       .pop();         ->      delete an element from end & return it.
                iv      -       .shift()        ->      delete from start & return it.
                v       -       .indexOf()      ->      return index of something.
                vi      -       .includes()     ->      search for a value if value exists or not.
                vii     -       .concat()       ->      merge 2 arrays.
                viii    -       .reverse()      ->      reverse an array.
                ix      -       .slice()        ->      copies a portion of an array.
                x       -       .splice()       ->      modify/delete parts of an array by adding
                                                        in this we have three arguments splice(start, deleteCount, item0...itemN).
                                                        here start is for index from which you want to start deleting the element,
                                                        deleteCount is for count how many items you want to delte.
                                                        item0...itemN is for adding an element to the index we mentioned in start.
                xi      -       .sort()         ->      sort the array.
        
        Array References        -       array references are basically the address of arrays. What all changes we will made in array,
                                        it will reflect in all its references arrays.
        
        Constant Arrays         -       when we make array constant we can only change or perform operations on that aray but cannot
                                        add a new array to that array.  
                                        const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

        Nested Arrays           -       array of arrays. Also known as multidimensional array.
                                        let num = [[2, 4], [3, 6], [4, 8]];
