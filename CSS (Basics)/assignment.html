    <!--Poem-->
    <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land,<br/>
        Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br/>
        Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br/>
        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br/>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br/>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br/>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br/>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br/>
        My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings;<br/>
        Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br/>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br/>
        Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br/>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<br/>
    </p>
