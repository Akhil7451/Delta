Alpha Channel   ->  Sets the opacity(visibility) for a color.
                    Range from 0 to 1.
                        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3)    //0.3 is alpha value.

opacity         ->  Set the opacity for the element.
                    Range from 0 to 1.(at 0 element disappears).
                        opacity: 0.5;

CSS Transition  ->  Transitions enable you to define the transition between two states of an element.
                    It has 4 properties ->
                            propert name | duration | timing-function | delay
                    transition: margin-top 2s ease-in-out 0.2s;

                    transition-delay: 1s;   (will set after hover transition should be delayed for 1s)
                    
                    transition-duration: 1s;(will set transition should take 1s).
                    
                    transition-timing-function: linear;  //learn more from mdn.
                    
                    transition-duration: 1s; //transition will take 1 sec.

                    margin: 0 auto; //align element to the center of the line.

CSS Transform   ->  This property lets you roatate, scalem or translate an element.

                i   -   Rotate ->  rotate the element.
                            transform: rotate(45deg).   //to rotate in anti-clockwise write transform: rotate(-45deg).

                ii  -   scale  ->  increase or decrease size of element with respect to X and Y axis.
                            transform: scale(0.5);  //this will half the element respect to both x and y axis.
                            transform: scale(0.5, 2);  //this will half the element respect to x and double the size with respect to y axis.
                            transform: scaleX(0.5);  //this will half the element respect to x axis.
                            transform: scaleY(0.5);  //this will half the element respect to y axis.

                iii -   Translate   ->  change the position of element with respect to x and y axis.
                            transform: translate(100px, 100px)    //this will move the element respect to both x and y axis.
                            transform: translateX(10px)
                            transform: translateY(10px)

                iv  -   Skew    ->  tilts the element.
                            transform: skew(30deg).

Box Shadow  ->  It adds shadow effect around an element's frame.
                box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px green; //5px-> x offset(shadow will be at a distance of 2px from x axis)
                                                //5px-> y offset(shadow will be at a distance of 2px from y axis)
                                                //10px-> blur radius(sets how much blur our shadow will be).
                                                //green-> color of shadow

Background Image    ->  Lets you set an image as a background.
                        background-image: url("name.jpg");
                        background-size: contain / cover / auto;    //contain   ->  if bg image is not fit with size it will repeat the image to fill tha area.
                                                                    //cover   ->  if bg image is not fit with size it will crop the image to fill tha area.
                                                                    //auto   ->  if bg image is not fit with size it will stretch the image to fill tha area.
                         
position    ->  The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.
                The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of positioned elements.

                i   -   static  ->  the top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect. This is the default value.
                                    position: static;

                ii  -   relative    ->  the offset is relative to itself(from the center of itself) based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
                                        position: relative;
                                        top: 100px;
                                        
                iii -   absolute    ->  The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
                                        It is positioned relative to its closet positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial
                                        containing block. In absolute which element is moved from its place so if we create another div it will be on the place of second one which was moved.
                                        position: absolute;
                                        top: 100px;

                iv  -   fixed        -> The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout.
                                        It is positioned relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport.
                                        In absolute which element is moved from its place so if we create another div it will be on the place of second one which was moved.
                                        Read its exception on mdn.
                                        position: fixed;
                                        top: 100px;
