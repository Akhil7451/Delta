CSS Grid    -   Setting a container's display to grid will make all children grid items.
                container{
                    display: grid;      //display the elements column wise with some space between them.
                }

                Grid can be inline too..    ->
                    container{

                    grid-template-rows: repeat(count, 1fr)  //divide the container's height in count parts equally as row.
                    grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr)  ==  grid-template-rows: repeat(1fr, 1fr)

    z-index ->  It decides the stack level of elements.
                Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.
                When z-index of all elements are same than element whose properties are defined at last will overlap.
                element whose position is static or have a by default position we can not set z-index for that elements.

                z-index: auto(0)
                z-index: 1/2/....
                z-index: 1/-2/...
