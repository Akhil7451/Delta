Flex    -       Flexible Box Layout(Flex) Helps to make our website responsive.
                It is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows and columns.
        
                Flex Model  ->  horizontal axis = main axis = x-axis        //in case when elements are row wise.
                                vertical axis = cross axis = y-axis
        
                                vertical axis = main axis = x-axis        //in case when elements are column wise.
                                horizontal axis = cross axis = y-axis
        
        
        
                If we gives any property to container that is called flex container. If we want to add flex to elements than add display: flex; property to that container.

        FlexBox Direction   ->  It sets how flex items are placed in the flex container, along which axis and direction.

                i   -   flex-direction: row;             //main axis left to right
                ii  -   flex-direction: row-reverse;     //main axis right to left
                iii -   flex-direction: column;          //cross axis top to bottom
                vi  -   flex-direction: column-reverse;  //cross axis bottom to top

                display: flex;                  //by default it keeps the element inside container in row.
                display-direction: colums       //it keeps the element inside container in column.

                if we set width of element less than width of a container then their size is reduced but if there width is more than the container's width
                then by default flex will reduce there width and fixed them according to the width of a container.

        Justify Content -   Tells how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main axis.(spaces along x-axis between elements inside a container.)

                i   -   justify-content: flex-start;     //shift all the element to the start
                ii  -   justify-content: flex-end;       //shift all the element to the end
                iii -   justify-content: center;         //shift all the element to the center
                iv  -   justify-content: space-between;  //assign the space between all the element.
                v   -   justify-content: space-around;   //assign the space around all the element. The space before and after first and last element respectively is less then the space between all other elements.
                vi  -   justify-content: space-evenly;   //assign the space around all the element equally before and after first and last elements respectively.

        Flex Wrap   -   Sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or can wrap onto multiple lines.

                i   -   flex-wrap: wrap;          // if there is no space for any content in first line than it will goes to next line. 
                ii  -   flex-wrap: nowrap;        // it will not wrap a content.
                iii -   flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;  // wrap in a reverse direction along with y-axis.

        Align items -   Distributes our items along the cross axis.

                i   -   align-items: flex-start;          //    distribute all the spaces along cross axis(from top to bottom)
                ii  -   align-items: flex-end;            //    (from bottom to top)
                iii -   align-items: center;              //    items sets in center along with cross axis.
                iv  -   justify-content: baseline;        //    align the content along the same line of text.

        Align Content   - It sets the distribution of space between and around content items along a flexbox's cross-axis.

                i   -   align-content: flec-start/flex-end/center                       //
                ii  -   align-content: space-between/space-around/space-evenly          //
                iii -   align-content: baseline;                                        //

        Align Self  -   Aligns an items along the cross axis. It is used to apply properties to individual items.
                
                i   -   align-self: flext-start;        //
                ii  -   align-self: flex-end;           //  
                iii -   align-self: center;             // 
                iv  -   align-self: baseline;           // 

        Flex Sizing -   Sets size of a flext item.

                i   -   flex-basis: 100px;      //It sets the initial main size of a flex item.
                ii  -   flex-grow: 1;           //It specifies how much of the flex container's remaining space should be assigned to flex item's size.
                        max-width: 50px;        //item will not exceed its width more than 50px;
                        max-height: 50px        //item will not exceed its height more than 50px;
                iii -   flex-shrink: 1;         //It sets the flex shrink factor of a flex-item.

                Flex Shorthand

                        i       -       flex-grow | flex-shrink | flex-basis
                                        flex: 2 2 100px;
                        ii      -       flex-grow | flex-basis
                                        flex: 2 100px;
                        iii     -       flex-grow(unitless)
                                        flex: 2;
                        iv      -       flex: 100px;
