Loops   -   Used to iterate a piece of code.
    
    -   for Loops    -  To loop through each element in an iterable object.
            
            Syntax: for(initialisation; condition; updation) {
                        //code block
                    }

    -   Nested for Loops    -   Loops inside a loop.

            Syntax: for(initialisation; condition; updation) {
                        //nested loop
                        for(initialisation; condition; updation) {
                            //code block
                        }   
                    }

    -   while loop  -  

            Syntax: while(condition) {
                        //do something
                    }

    -   break keyword   -   to stop the loop when the condition reached.

Loops with Arrays   -   loops to iterate in arrays or to perform function with arrays.

    -   Nested Loops with Nested Arrays -   loops to iterate in nested arrays.
    
For of Loop -   used when we want to access the items of collection.

            Syntax: for(element of collection) {
                        //do something
                    }

Nested for of Loop  -

            Syntax: for(element of collection) {
                        for(element of element) {
                            //do something
                        }
                    }
