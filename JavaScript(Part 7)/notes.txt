this Keyword    -   "This" keyword refers to an object that is executing the current piece of code.
                    Methods in our object can not directly access the perameters of that object.
                    Scope for this keyword in normal function calling object.

                       const student = {
                            name: "Akhil",
                            age: 22,
                            eng: 95,
                            math: 93,
                            phy: 97,
                            getAvg() {
                                let avg = (this.eng + this.math + this.phy) / 3;
                                console.log(`Average of 3 subjects is ${avg}.`);
                            } 
                        }
                        console.log(student.getAvg());

try & catch     -   The try statement allow you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
                    The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

                        try {
                            console.log(a);
                        } catch {
                            console.log("varibale a doesn't exist);
                        }

    ->  Arrow Function  -   it is also a method to write function. These functions are used as variables. These are nameless functions.

                                const func = (arg1, arg2...) => {function definition};

                                const sum = (a, b) => {
                                    console.log(a + b);
                                }

        Implicit return -   in this function nothing will do only it will return the value.

                                const func = (arg1, arg2...) => {value};

                                const mul = (a, b) => (
                                    a * b
                                );

        Set Timeout     -   It is an inbuilt function of window object. It sets a timer for our work. It takes time in ms so if we want to set time for 4s we have to write 4000.
                            
                                setTimeout(function, timeout)

                                console.log("hi there!");
                                setTimeout( () => {
                                    console.log("Apna College");
                                }, 4000);
                                console.log("welcome to");

        Set Interval    -   It is an inbuilt function of window object. It sets a interval of time for our work. It takes time in ms so if we want to set time for 2s we have to write 2000.
                            But it executes continuosly after the given interval of time. Untill we stops it.

                                setInterval(function, interval)

                                let id = setInterval(() => {
                                    console.log("Apna College");
                                }, 2000);

                                //To stop 
                                
                                clearInterval(id);

    this with Arrow functions   -    Scope for this keyword in arrow function is the scope of its parent object. It will inherit the scope of its parent.
